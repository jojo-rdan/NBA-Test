# Project - NBA inches calculator test

## About the project:

  I did this project as a technical test for a private company. I built a simple Front-End side with the solution.
        
  - Front-end:
      - React.js
      - Axios
      - HTML5/CSS
        
  - Functionality:
      - The user is able to enter a number of inches and the program will return the pair of NBA players that add up to the total number of inches passed per input.

 ## How to start the project:
 
   - Clone the repo and open it with your code editor.
   - Open a terminal over the client folder and the api folder.
   - Make nodemon index.js over the api folder to run the server.
   - Make npm start over the client folder to run the front.
